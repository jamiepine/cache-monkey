    <h4>🤔 What is a cache?</h4>
    <p>Caching is common practice by apps to help decreace server bandwidth costs and improve loadtimes. If an app can save media to your device, it need not request it from the server again.</p>
    <h4>🔑 What apps does CacheMonkey support?</h4>
    <p>In theory, anything with a "Cache" folder, if you can locate it, we should be able to convert it to the original filetype and allow you to view it with this app.</p>
    <h4>🛠 Developers, you can help!</h4>
    <p>
      The source code for this app is available on
      <a
        href="#"
        @click.prevent="open('https://github.com/jamiepine/cache-monkey')"
      >GitHub</a>, I made it in just two days so it could use a clean-up. It's built with NodeJS, VueJS and Electron (I've disabled caching, don't worry about possible cache-ception). Massive thanks to

      >Tetrabyte</a> for working with me to get this app released so quickly.
